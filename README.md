# Pedestrian_Models
This is my personal modeling framework for pedestrian models. There are 2D, 1D and delayed 1D models implemented. Furthermore some basic framework to analyze trajectory data.

It is only for my personal scientific use right now - so it might be a little difficult to see through.
